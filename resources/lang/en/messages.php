    Thank you for finding my homepage!
    
    I am Helen. I enjoy glassware and Im from Saaremaa. I sometimes need unlimited free time to dream and time to make my dreams come true.
    
    The secret with which you can achieve everything in life is first a strong desire to achieve something.
    
    Then you have to have a definite ideal and you have to see how it progresses step by step without ever having to doubt it.
    
    My life has given me the opportunity to deal with stained glass, mosaic and hot glass.
    
    Seeing the birth of glass from fire and sand, believing in yourself and bounding the borders has given me
    
    the confidence that I can do my ideas.'
